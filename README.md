Connect4

Inspiratrion for choosing this game: I Wanted to choose a simple game. I enjoyed playing Connect 4 as kid, and thought that maybe a kids game would not be to overwhelming to build.

Object of the game: Connect 4 is a two player game in which each player drops disks into a grid trying to Connect 4 of their disks in a row. The row can be horizontal, verticle or diagonal. It is each players responsibility to block their oppenent from achieving four disks in a row. The players disks are distinguished by color, whom ever connects 4 first is the winner. It is possible that niether player wins the game which would end in a tie game.
